```python
     # Your code here
     ```
     ``````

    Note: The code should be written in a way that it can be easily read and understood by a Python developer.

    Here is the code to get you started:
     ```python
     # Define the database schema
     class Expense:
         def __init__(self, id, category, amount, date):
             self.id = id
             self.category = category
             self.amount = amount
             self.date = date

     # Define the business logic layer
     class ExpenseTracker:
         def __init__(self):
             self.expenses = []

         def add_expense(self, expense):
             self.expenses.append(expense)

         def categorize_expenses(self):
             # TO DO: implement expense categorization logic
             pass

         def generate_report(self):
             # TO DO: implement report generation logic
             pass
     ```
     ``````

    Please implement the core functionality described in the prompt, focusing only on the business logic layer and report generation. 

    The business logic layer should handle the categorization of expenses and generate reports. The report generation should include the following features:
    *   Total expenses by category
    *   Average expense amount by category
    *   Total expenses by date
    *   Average expense amount by date

    The report generation should be implemented using the `generate_report` method of the `ExpenseTracker` class. 

    Please provide the updated code with clear comments explaining what each part of the code does.
